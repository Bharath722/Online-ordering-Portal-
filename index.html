                                    <p>Banks deal with individuals, business entities, public enterprises, government,
                                        charity organisations and many others for their banking requirements which are 
                                        financial in nature. The process involves dealing with large number of transactions, 
                                        accounting processes and data processing. Before the advent of information technology, 
                                        all these transactions were done manually. It used to be labour‚Äêintensive and time‚Äê 
                                        consuming. Inter‚Äêcity transactions used to take days if not month(s).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Developments in the field of information and communication technology have 
                                        altered the banking scenario. The world has become one for all practical purposes in 
                                        regard to conducting financial transactions amongst entities irrespective of their 
                                        location. The time as well as effort required in conducting transactions, accounting and 
                                        generating reports has been drastically reduced. The accuracy and control over bank 
                                        operations have undergone a sea change.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    About three decades back the transformation began. Changes in technology have
                                    been fast and comprehensive. The software solutions now cover almost all logically 
                                    defined banking activities. The secured messaging system has now been standardised to 
                                    enable seamless secured communication between two different software applications. 
                                    The hardware has become more rugged, smaller and cheaper. The communication 
                                    channels have moved from leased line to Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) to mobile 
                                    communication. The cost of acquisition of technology has reduced substantially. The 
                                    messaging system is now becoming more and more secured, moving towards 
                                    finger/eye/face recognition. The networking technologies have further brought 
                                    everyone on to a single platform. The mobile communication system has enhanced the 
                                    convenience to do transactions while being on the move.

                                    Technology driven ‚ÄòSmart Banking‚Äô is the backbone of today‚Äôs successful banks.
                                    While it is necessary to follow the fundamentals of sound banking practices, it is of 
                                    paramount importance for banks to switch over to ‚ÄòSmart Banking‚Äô to be able to remain 
                                    in competition. The latest innovations in Information and Communication Technology 
                                    need to be leveraged to create new products and services. The Technology today is no 
                                    longer only an enabler of banking, but it drives banking, creating opportunities to 
                                    develop more products and services. ‚ÄòSmart Banking‚Äô is a win‚Äêwin situation for both, the
                                    bank and its customers. While it provides convenience of anytime anywhere online 
                                    banking to customers, it enables banks to have operational control, efficiency and 
                                    critical MIS.

                                    Banks have inducted technology in almost every vertical of banking. This has
                                    enabled the banks to offer more and more facilities which had never been envisaged 
                                    before. This is an ongoing process with more and more innovative applications being 
                                    employed every day. Key technology driven banking products, services and solutions are

                                    <p>
                                    Similarly, there are several activities which, though a part of banking, are outside
                                    the operating domain of CBS e.g., Treasury, Asset Liability Management, Anti‚ÄêMoney 
                                    Laundering system and Customer Relationship Management etc. To carry out these 
                                    activities, banks require Software Solutions. These solutions have their own 
                                    independent logic, systems and processes. These software solutions are independently 
                                    hosted and are connected to the CBS. Only the transactions relating to bank accounts, 
                                    generated from these solutions, are reflected in the CBS.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    In addition, there are activities which are not essential core banking activities but 
                                    still form an important part of overall bouquet of services of the banks. For example 
                                    Cash Management System, Wealth Management, Demat Services, Management of Fixed 
                                    Assets like land/building/furniture, Human Resource Management and Share Capital 
                                    Management etc. In order to undertake these activities, banks acquire separate 
                                    software solutions which are integrated with the CBS.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Besides, banks are required to connect with the outside financial payment systems 
                                    for inter‚Äêbank financial transactions like Card Payment Network, RTGS, NEFT, IMPS and
                                    SWIFT etc. For this, they install customised software solutions which are connected to 
                                    CBS on one hand and to the external payment systems on the other to enable seamless 
                                    processing of transactions between CBS and the external systems.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    CBS is at the centre of entire banking operations. All other systems converge into it. 
                                    The integration of CBS with other software solutions is through standardised Secured
                                    Financial Transaction Messaging System and Application Programming Interface. 
                                    However, each software application requires customisation for integrating with the CBS 
                                    structure for seamless processing of transactions. While the aforementioned 
                                    supplemental systems contain domain specific data, CBS provides up‚Äêto‚Äêdate 
                                    information about ongoing banking operations in the books of accounts of the bank.
                                    </p>

                                    This book has been divided into seven parts. First three parts contain details of core 
                                    retail banking operations. Fourth part gives overview of treasury, securities and foreign 
                                    exchange trading systems whereas fifth part provides information about other key 
                                    systems and solutions. Sixth part consists of introduction to financial communication 
                                    networks which are the backbone of entire electronic banking system. In the last and 
                                    seventh part of the book authors talk about the key initiatives of the Reserve Bank of 
                                    India and the way forward.

									<p>The onset of new age private sector banks in the early 1990s paved the way for large scale 
									changes in the Indian banking sector. These banks incorporated the latest technological gadgets 
									for banking operations which resulted in speedier and more reliable transactions. 
									This was a win-win situation both for the banks as well as for their customers. 
									Technological upgradations were done, slowly albeit surely, by public sector banks 
									and the old age private sector banks as well. The smarter banks seized the opportunity 
									and moved miles ahead of others on the back of innovative technology driven products and services. 
									These developments gave birth to a new term called ‚Äúsmart banking‚Äù to differentiate technology led 
									banking from traditional way of doing the business of banking.</p>
									<p>Since in ‚Äúsmart banking‚Äù both technology and banking are closely intertwined, it is a challenge to 
									keep abreast of the latest in the banking technology. 
									The latest would include big data, cloud computing, smart phones, 
									use of home video-conferencing system for personalized connect and other such innovations.</p>
									<p>From the banker‚Äôs perspective, better technology also leads to cost cutting. 
									As per World Bank estimates, the operational cost per transaction for 
									Indian Banks is Rs. 48 per branch, Rs. 25 for phone banking, 
									Rs. 18 for ATM, Rs. 8 for IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and 
									Rs. 4 for online transaction. Who would have thought some years back 
									that banking transactions could be done hands on through mobile. 
									The annual report of Reserve Bank of India states that the average value 
									of transactions via mobile phones in 2014-15 has beaten the average value of transactions in credit and debit cards. 
									It appears that mobile banking and mobile payments & commerce are truly the future.</p>
								 
                                    <p>One of the most difficult things in the world is to make things simple. This book brings out 
									various aspects of banking and the technology associated with them in simple terms. The book has been written 
									in easy to understand language even for non-bankers. Bankers may find many areas of learning outside their 
									current domain of activity. It may also be useful to persons engaged in banking software sector.</p>
									
									<p>The authors of this book are men of letters and high learning. I feel happy and honoured to 
									introduce this book. I am sure it will scale up the knowledge of the readers with regard to technology driven 
									banking and would also give impetus to bankers to be one step ahead of each other for further technological upgradations.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-center">PREFACE</h3>
									<p>The emergence of new technologies and expectations of tech‚Äêsavvy customers has brought about a paradigm shift in the lifestyle of people across the world. E‚Äêcommerce has altered the shopping style. The speed and accuracy of doing things has dramatically accelerated.</p>
									<p>Banking is no exception and globally, every aspect of banking has undergone a sea change. Indian banks have also not been found wanting and have geared up to adapt and absorb technological innovations and solutions in banking.</p>
									<p>While earlier, technology was only an enabler, it is now seen as the driver of banking services and banking business and the future seems even more challenging and exciting.</p>
								 
                                    <p>It is no longer sufficient to be an efficient bank. One has to be a ‚Äòsmart‚Äô bank offering state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart products and services.</p>
									
									<p>The rapid strides made in technology due to faster, wider and cheaper communication network; miniaturization, ruggedness and durability of hardware and storage devices; larger and faster CPU capacities; standardised secured messaging between different software applications; development of newer delivery channel devices and development of core banking solutions along with various other banking software products and services gave rise and provided impetus to many new products and services which were truly beyond imagination.</p>
                                    <p>In India, acceptance of new technology in banking was delayed a little, essentially, due to the resistance of the workforce which feared loss of jobs. The steps taken to open up the economy in the early nineties witnessed the entry of new generation private banks. These banks started with the latest technology available and soon captured the imagination of the people. The rapid inroads these banks made into the banking business showcased the power of technology. Very soon public sector banks followed suit. Today, there is hardly any discipline in banking which is untouched by technology.</p>
									<p>‚ÄòAny Branch Banking‚Äô, ‚ÄòAnywhere Banking‚Äô, ‚ÄòAnytime Banking‚Äô, ‚ÄòBanking from Home‚Äô and ‚ÄòBanking
on the Move ‚Äòhave all eased banking transactions for the people who need not visit their banks for doing business. The technology has taken banking to those areas where no bank had ever reached. With the help of technology, leakages in dispensation of relief to the poor are being plugged through direct credit of money in the accounts of the beneficiaries. Money laundering is being checked through tracking transactions online with the help of technology.</p>
									<p>Technology has enabled banks not only to improve their operational efficiency but also has brought about new products and services. Transaction banking is almost entirely automated. Customer Relation Management and Data Analytics are being used to enhance understanding of the business and customer base. Software solutions have been developed for auto‚Äêprocessing and monitoring of loans. Digitisation of money is reducing the need for physical cash. Paper based
payment system is fast migrating into electronic mode.</p>
                                    <p>The need for physical cash has now been reduced to petty payments. Not very distant is
the prospect of doing away with the cash for most of our day to day requirements. This
will result in the aggregation of this category of capital which is currently lying in the pockets
of individuals. It will not only provide security to the people but will also create large financial
resources for economic development.</p>
                                    <p>Banking education in general revolves around knowledge about banking and sometimes
in specialised technology domains. The knowledge about technology application in banking is
generally limited to the people in their respective domains of banking and technology. This book
is an attempt to create common understanding amongst students, customers and bankers in
general.</p>
                                   <p>The book is not a comprehensive compendium of banking technologies but is aimed at
familiarising the readers with the main technology applications in Indian banks.</p>

									<p>Technology is playing increasingly greater role in transforming our lives at an accelerated pace 

across every spectrum, in general, and the financial eco-system in particular. Technology has 

become an important differentiator in the financial eco-system and is playing strategic role in 

devising modern financial business models. It is equally important in transforming the brick and 

mortar banks/ financial institutions, in improving their relevance in the wake of exponentially rising 

customer‚Äôs aspirations and the rapidly changing competitive financial world.</p>
									<p>The book written by Dr. Vinay Kumar Nangia and Shri Sunil Aggarwal delineates the working 

details of various components of modern digital banking transactions. In this background, the book 

assumes immense significance. It would be quite useful for students, teachers, professionals, 

practitioners and other stakeholders of the financial world alike.</p>
